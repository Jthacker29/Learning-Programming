/* The DELETE statement deletes existing rows in a table. The FROM keyword
is followed by the table name whose rows are to be deleted. An optional WHERE
clause specifies which rows should be deleted. Omitting the WHERE clause
results in all rows in the table being deleted. 
The below example deletes rows from TableName where the condition is met*/

DELETE FROM TableName
WHERE condition;

DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE ID = 6381;

/* The above will delete the rows with the ID 6381. */

DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 40000 AND
      Salary < 80000;

/* The above will delete rows where the salary is between 40000 and 80000. */

DELETE FROM Employee;

/* The above will delete all of the employee rows. */
