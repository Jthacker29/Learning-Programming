/* The INSERT statement adds rows to a table. The INSERT statement has two clauses
The INSERT INTO clause names the table and the columns where data is to be added (Keyword INTO optional)
The VALUES clause specifies the column values to be added. In the example below the TableName is to be
replaced by the table that we are updating. The Column1, Column2, section is name of the olumns
we wish to update, which use the values from the Value1, Value2, etc section.. */

INSERT [INTO] TableName (Column1, Column2, etc)
VALUES (Value1, Value2, etc)

INSERT INTO Employee (ID, EmployeeName, Salary)
VALUES (2538, 'Lisa Ellison', 45000);

/* In the above example, the new row would have 2538 in the ID column
'Lisa Ellison' in the EmployeeName column, and 45000 in the Salary column */

INSERT INTO Employee
VALUES (2538, 'Lisa Ellison', 45000)

/* The same follows for the above example, in this case so long as the values 
match the columns order they will be updated as needed. */

INSERT INTO Employee
VALUES (6381, 'Maria Rodriguez', 92300),
       (7920, 'Jiho Chen', 56000),
      (9385, 'Alexis Parsons', 32000);

/* In the above example, we do not declare the columns we are using, though
the program will interpret which need to be updated. This will create three
new rows with the values above. Following this example we can add as many rows
as we need when updating rows */
