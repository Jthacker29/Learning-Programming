/* The UPDATE statement modifies existing rows in a table. The UPDATE statement
uses the SET clause to specify the new column values. An optional WHERE clause
specifies which rows are updated. Omitting the WHERE clause results in all rows being updated.
TableName is replaced by the table you wish to update. Column1 & Column2 are replaced by the 
values from Value1 & Value2. Condition is replaced by whatever you wish to update if the 
requirements are met. */
