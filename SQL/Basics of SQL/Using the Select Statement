separated by commas, that determine what values are returned from each row. */

this information is assembled into a table called the RESULT TABLE There are some cases where a table is too long or has too
much information (rows), in this event we can use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows returned by our SELECT clause
the following example will only return 100 rows no matter how large the table may be. */
