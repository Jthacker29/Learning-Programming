/* As we mentioned in the NULL Comparisons section, we cannot return values that equate to NULL or have NULL in any of their operands
Instead, we must use the IS NULL and the IS NOT NULL operators. When we use these we can select NULL values. For example if we have
Value IS NULL, it would return true when the value is NULL. Value IS NOT NULL returns true when the value is NOT NULL. */

/* The above would return rows where there is a NULL value in

SELECT *

/* The above would return rows where there are NOT NULL values in the
