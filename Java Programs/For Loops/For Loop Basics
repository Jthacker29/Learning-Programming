/* for (initialExpression; conditionExpression; updateExpression) {
  // Loop body
}
// Statements after the loop
Above is an example of a basic for loop 

int i;
i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    //Loop Body 
    i = i + 1;
}
The while loop above is equivalent to the for loop below
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    //Loop Body
} 
Comparing the parts you can see how they fit together.
The initial value of i (or your variable) goes at the start, followed by a semicolon
the next value is the loop expression, or how many times it will iterate to or the
variable that it will find itself evaluating to, and after the next semicolon 
is the last value, or the increment per iteration. 
We can also replace i = i + 1 with ++i as an increment operator
or --i as a decrement operator.
The ++ operator can appear as ++i (prefix form) or as i++ (postfix form).
 ++i increments i first and then evaluates the result, while i++ evaluates the result first
  and then increments i. The distinction is relevant in a statement like
 x = ++i vs. x = i++; if i is 5, the first yields x = 6, the second x = 5. */
